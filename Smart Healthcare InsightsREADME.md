### 📌 Business Problem (WHY)

Healthcare organizations handle large volumes of patient and operational data, but decision-makers often lack a single, clear view of hospital performance. Without consolidated reporting, it becomes difficult to track patient flow, department load, and operational efficiency. This project was created to solve that gap.

### 📊 Dataset (WHAT DATA)

* Patient visit records
* Department-wise data
* Appointment dates and volumes
* Operational indicators related to healthcare services

### 🧹 Data Preparation (HOW)

* Cleaned missing and inconsistent department names
* Standardized date formats for time-based analysis
* Built relationships between patient, department, and date tables
* Created calculated columns and measures for performance tracking

### 🎯 KPIs Defined (WHY THESE KPIs)

* Total Patients → Overall hospital workload
* Department-wise Visits → Resource and staffing planning
* Visit Trends → Peak vs off-peak analysis
* Utilization Rate → Operational efficiency measurement

### 📈 Dashboard Design

* Management overview page for quick monitoring
* Department-level comparison visuals
* Trend analysis over time
* Interactive slicers for department and date filtering

### 🔍 Key Insights

* A small number of departments handle the majority of patient visits

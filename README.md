## Smart Healthcare Insights

### 📌 About This Project

This project focuses on applying data analytics in the healthcare domain to help hospital management monitor patient flow, department workload, and operational efficiency. The goal was to convert complex healthcare data into a clear, centralized decision-support dashboard.

The analysis covers data cleaning, relationship modeling, KPI definition, and interactive visualization to highlight utilization patterns, peak periods, and department-wise performance. The dashboard is designed for non-technical stakeholders, ensuring insights are easy to interpret and actionable.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with domain-specific data, translate operational challenges into analytics solutions, and support better resource planning in healthcare environments.


### 📌 Business Problem (WHY)

Healthcare organizations handle large volumes of patient and operational data, but decision-makers often lack a single, clear view of hospital performance. Without consolidated reporting, it becomes difficult to track patient flow, department load, and operational efficiency. This project was created to solve that gap.

### 📊 Dataset (WHAT DATA)

* Patient visit records
* Department-wise data
* Appointment dates and volumes
* Operational indicators related to healthcare services

### 🧹 Data Preparation (HOW)

* Cleaned missing and inconsistent department names
* Standardized date formats for time-based analysis
* Built relationships between patient, department, and date tables
* Created calculated columns and measures for performance tracking

### 🎯 KPIs Defined (WHY THESE KPIs)

* Total Patients → Overall hospital workload
* Department-wise Visits → Resource and staffing planning
* Visit Trends → Peak vs off-peak analysis
* Utilization Rate → Operational efficiency measurement

### 📈 Dashboard Design

* Management overview page for quick monitoring
* Department-level comparison visuals
* Trend analysis over time
* Interactive slicers for department and date filtering

### 🔍 Key Insights

* A small number of departments handle the majority of patient visits
* Certain days and time periods consistently experience peak load
* Opportunities exist to optimize staff allocation

### 🚀 Business Impact

Supports hospital administrators in improving operational planning, patient experience, and efficient use of resources.
